# README Questions & Answers

## 1. How would you optimize API calls in this application for performance?
To optimize API calls, I would implement **caching mechanisms** (e.g., Vuex/Pinia store, browser storage) to avoid unnecessary network requests. **Debouncing and throttling** techniques can be applied to reduce frequent API calls for real-time interactions. Additionally, **lazy loading** and **pagination** ensure only required data is fetched. Using **batch requests** where possible and **optimizing backend responses** (e.g., returning only necessary fields) can further enhance performance.

## 2. Describe your approach to handling shared logic between components.
I would structure shared logic using **composable functions (Vue 3)** or **mixins (Vue 2)** to encapsulate reusable functionalities like authentication, form validation, or API handling. **Pinia or Vuex** would be used for state management, ensuring global data (e.g., user authentication state) is accessible without excessive prop drilling. Utility functions for formatting, data transformation, and validation would also be centralized in a separate utility folder.

## 3. How would you implement client-side data caching for this dashboard?
For client-side caching, I would use **Vuex/Pinia with persistence plugins** to store data locally. API responses can be cached using **browser storage (LocalStorage, IndexedDB)** and **service workers** to enable offline access. For real-time updates, I would apply a **stale-while-revalidate** strategy where cached data is shown first while fetching fresh data in the background. If using GraphQL, **Apollo Client caching** would be another effective approach.

## 4. What strategy would you use to scale this application if it needed to support hundreds of different user permission types?
To scale the application, I would implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** or **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**, ensuring efficient permission handling at both frontend and backend levels. The permissions structure would be **modular**, possibly using a **permissions API endpoint** where roles and access levels can be dynamically retrieved and cached. On the frontend, **route guards and directive-based permission checking** would be used to restrict access to specific UI components.

## 5. Explain your testing strategy and how you decided what to test.
I would implement a **multi-layered testing strategy**:
- **Unit tests** for critical functions (e.g., API services, authentication) using **Vitest/Jest**.
- **Integration tests** for Vue components to verify interactions using **Vue Test Utils**.
- **End-to-End (E2E) tests** using **Cypress or Playwright** to simulate real user flows.

Testing would focus on **authentication**, **API calls**, **state management interactions**, and **form validation**, ensuring core functionality is covered while keeping tests maintainable.

## 6. How would you handle offline capabilities in this application?
For offline capabilities, I would use **service workers** to cache essential API responses and static assets. **IndexedDB or LocalStorage** would store user-related data locally, allowing the application to function with limited features when offline. A **sync mechanism** would be implemented to queue offline actions and process them once the user reconnects. If needed, the app could be built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for enhanced offline support.

## **Important Note**
Due to **time constraints**, I was unable to complete all of the required features and optimizations for this project. However, I have structured the application to be **scalable, maintainable, and extendable**, ensuring that additional improvements can be implemented efficiently in the future.
